    "A Viterbi path is a path for which the Viterbi score is attained. We can compute one of the Viterbi paths with a straightforward extension of the Viterbi scoring algorithm. At each state when we compute the score, we also maintain a backpointer to the arc which resulted in the maximum score. When the algorithm terminates, we can trace the backpointers to the start state and extract the Viterbi path.\n",
