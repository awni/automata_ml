    "A Viterbi path is a path for which the Viterbi score is attained. We can compute one of the Viterbi paths with a straightforward extension of the Viterbi scoring algorithm. At each state when we compute the score, we also maintain a back-pointer to the arc which resulted in the maximum score. When the algorithm terminates, we can trace the back-pointers to the start state and extract the Viterbi path.\n",

In order to compute the Viterbi path, we trace the red arcs back from the accept state. In this case the Viterbi path state sequence is $0 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 6$ with arc labels $b$, $c$, and $b$.\n",
