This is important to any type of gradient-based numerical optimization, of which the most commonly used are variations of stochastic gradient descent. The parameters, $\\theta$, of the model are specified in tensors. The objective function, $f(\\theta, \\vx, \\vy)$, is a function of the parameters and the input data $\\vx$ and $\\vy$. The parameters can then be optimized to improve the objective with variations of a simple update rule:\n",

    "Many operations used with vectors, matrices, and $n$-dimensional tensors are differentiable. This means we can compute the change in any of the output elements with respect to an infinitesimal change in any of the input elements. For example, consider a vector $\\vz = f(\\vx, \\vy)$ which is the output of a function of two vectors $\\vx$ and $\\vy$. The Jacobian of $\\vz$ with respect to $\\vx$ is the matrix of partial derivatives with entries $\\frac{\\partial \\vz_i}{\\partial \\vx_j}$. The gradient is defined as the tensor of partial derivatives of a scalar function. So if $f(\\vx) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a scalar function, then the gradient is:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the same way, we can compute partial derivatives of the arc weights of an output graph for a given operation with respect to the arc weights of any of the input graphs. Take the concatenation operation as an example. Suppose we are given two graphs, $\\gA$ and $\\gB$, and we construct the concatenated graph $\\gC = \\gA \\gB$ as in the figure below.\n",

Automatic differentiation greatly simplifies the process of computing derivatives for arbitrary compositions of operations. In this section, we will discuss *reverse-mode* automatic differentiation at a high-level.\n",

    "Reverse-mode automatic differentiation proceeds in two steps. First, a forward pass computes all of the operations. Then, a backward pass computes the gradients. During the forward pass the composition of operations is stored in a computation graph (not to be confused with an automata). Data and metadata are also cached during the forward pass to make the gradient computation more efficient. There is often a trade-off between memory and compute in that we can save more intermediate data to reduce the computation required during but increase the memory required during the backward pass.\n",

In this case, let's assume $\\gA_1$ and $\\gA_2$ are the parameter graphs, and $\\gX$ is the graph of input data. The square nodes are operations, and they are always followed by output graphs, which are dashed circular nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the backward pass, the gradients are computed from the output ($\\gG_4$ in the graph above) following the arrows in the computation graph backwards. A graph can only compute its gradient once all of the graphs downstream of it have had their gradients computed. Thus the backward pass must be done as a reverse topological traversal of the computation graph.\n",

One simple approach is to have every output graph record the input graphs from which it was generated as well as a gradient computation function.
