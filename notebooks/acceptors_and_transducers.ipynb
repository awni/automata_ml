    "\\DeclareMathOperator*{\\LSE}{\\textrm{LSE}}$The broad class of graphs we are going to look at are finite-state automata. These include deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) and non-deterministic finite-state automata (NFAs). More specifically we will consider a generalization of DFAs and NFAs called weighted finite-state acceptors (WFSAs). That's a mouthful, so I will just call them *acceptors*. We will also consider a further generalization of an acceptor called a *transducer* (weighted finite-state transducers or WFSTs). The following figure shows the relation between these three graphs; transducers, acceptors, and automata. Transducers are the most expressive in terms of their representational power, followed by acceptors followed by unweighted automata.\n",

    "Before we dive into acceptors and transducers, let's introduce some general graph terminology that I will use throughout. In the following graph a *state* or *node* is represented by a circle. The arrows represent connections between two states. We usually refer to these as *arcs* but sometimes also *edges*. The graph is directed since the connections between states are unidirectional arrows. The arcs in a graph can have labels. In the graph below the arc between states $0$ and $1$ has a label of $a$. Similarly, the arc between states $1$ and $2$ has a label of $b$. The graph is an example of a finite-state automata (FSA) or finite-state machine (FSM), so called because it has a finite number of nodes. \n",

The scores of the individual arcs on the path are summed. The path scores are combined with *log-sum-exp*. So the weight of the transduced pair $(ab, xz)$ in the above graph is $0+3 = 3$.\n",
