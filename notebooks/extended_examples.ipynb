    "\n",
    "In machine-learning applications with sequential data, we often need to compute a conditional probability of an output sequence given an input sequence when the two sequences do not have the same length. The Automatic Segmentation criterion (ASG) is one of several common loss functions for which this is possible. However, ASG is limited to the case when the output sequence is no longer than the input sequence. \n",

We don't know the actual alignment between $\\mX$ and $\\vy$, and in many applications we don't need it. For example, in speech recognition $\\mX$ consists of frames of Fourier-transformed audio, and $\\vy$ could be letters of a transcript. We usually don't need to know how $\\vy$ aligns to $\\mX$; we only require that $\\vy$ is the correct transcript. To get around not knowing this alignment, the ASG criterion marginalizes over all possible alignments between $\\mX$ and $\\vy$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ASG, the output sequence is aligned to a given input by allowing one or more consecutive repeats of each token in the output. Suppose we have an input of length $5$ and the output sequence $ab$. Some possible alignments of the output are $aaabb$, $abbbb$, and $aaaab$. Some invalid alignments are $abbbba$, $aaab$, and $aaaaa$. These are invalid because the first corresponds to the output $aba$, the second is too short, and the third corresponds to the output $a$.\n",

Let $\\va = [a_1, \\ldots, a_T]$ be one possible alignment between $\\mX$ and $\\vy$. The alignment $\\va$ also has length $T$.

The scores on the arcs are given by the model $s_t(\\cdot)$. These scores are often called the *emissions*, and the graph itself is sometimes called the emissions graph. I'll use $\\gE$ to represent the emissions graph. In this case the emissions graph $\\gE$ is the same as the normalization graph $\\gZ_\\mX$; however, in general they may be different.

The graphs $\\gT$ and $\\gY$ are transducers and their order in the composition makes a difference. Because of the way we constructed them, we will only get the correct $\\gA_\\vy$ if $\\gT$ is the first argument to the composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we can compute the ASG loss just as before. The remaining graphs $\\gE$ and $\\gB$ are unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "This decomposition of the ASG loss using simple graph building blocks makes it easier to change. In the following section, I will show how to construct a different algorithm, Connectionist Temporal Classification, with only a minor modification to the ASG loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connectionist Temporal Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) is another loss function which assigns a conditional probability $p(\\vy \\mid \\mX)$ when the input length $T$ and output length $U$ are variable, and the alignment between them is unknown. Like ASG, CTC gets around the fact that the alignment is unknown by assuming a set of allowed alignments and marginalizing over this set. In CTC, the length of the output $\\vy$ is also constrained in terms of the length of the input. For CTC, the output length $U$ must satisfy $U + R_\\vy \\le T$, where $R_\\vy$ is the number of consecutive repeats in $\\vy$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ASG loss function has two modeling limitations which CTC attempts to improve. First, ASG does not elegantly handle repeat tokens in the output. Second, ASG does not allow for optional null inputs. I'll discuss each of these in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Repeat Tokens:** A repeat token is two consecutive tokens with the same value. For example, the $b$'s in $abba$ is a repeat, but the $a$ is not. In ASG, repeat tokens in the output create an ambiguity. A single alignment can map to multiple output sequences. For example, consider the alignment $abbbaa$. This can map to any of the outputs $aba$, $abba$, $abbba$, $abaa$, $abbaa$, or $abbbaa$. There are several heuristics to resolve this. One option is to use special tokens for repeat characters. For example if $\\vy = abba$, then we could encode it as $ab_2a$, where $b_2$ corresponds to two $b$'s.In this case,  the alignment $abbba$ corresponds to the output $aba$,the alignment $ab_2b_2b_2a$ corresponds to the output $abba$, and the alignment $abbb_2$ corresponds to $abbba$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two problems with this solution. First, we have to hard code into the token set an upper limit on the number of repeats to allow. Second, if we allow $n$ repeats, then we multiply the token set size by a factor of $n$ causing potential computation and sample efficiency issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blank Inputs:** The second problem with ASG is it dos not allow optional null inputs. Any output token $y_u$ must map to a corresponding input $\\vx_t$. In some cases, the $y_u$ may not meaningfully correspond to any input. The blank token in CTC allows for this by representing an input time step which does not correspond to any output.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll denote the CTC blank token with $\\blank$. The token $\\blank$ can appear zero or more times in the alignment, and it can be at the beginning, in between, or end of the tokens of the output $\\vy$. If $\\vy$ has consecutive repeats, then there must be at least one $\\blank$ between them in any alignment. So the optional blank token is a solution to both the modeling of null input time steps as well as repeat tokens in the output. Note also that non-optional blank between repeat tokens is why in CTC the output length must satisfy $U + R_\\vy < T$. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, suppose we have an input of length $5$ and the output sequence $abb$. Some allowed alignments are $abb \\blank b$, $ab \\blank bb$, or $aa b \\blank b$. Some alignments which are not allowed are $aabbb$ and $aa\\blank b b$, both of which correspond to the output $ab$ instead of $abb$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In equations, CTC is indistinguishable from ASG without transitions. The loss is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log p(\\vy \\mid \\mX) = \\LSE_{\\va \\in \\gA_{\\mX, \\vy}} \\log p(\\va).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between ASG and CTC is in the set of allowed alignments $\\gA_{\\mX, \\vy}$. Assuming we have log normalized scores on the arc weights of the emissions graph $\\gE$, the graph based CTC loss is: \n",
