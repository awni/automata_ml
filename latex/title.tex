    The goal of this work is to introduce the reader to weighted finite-state
    automata and their application to machine learning. I begin by motivating
    the use of automata in machine learning and proceed with an introduction to
    acceptors, transducers, and their associated properties. Many of the core
    operations of weighted automata are then described in detail. Following
    this, the work moves closer to the research frontier by explaining
    automatic differentiation and its use with weighted automata. The last
    section presents several extended examples to gain deeper familiarity with
    weighted automata, their operations, and applications to machine-learning.
