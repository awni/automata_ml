## automata_ml

An Introduction to Weighted Automata in Machine Learning

This repo contains the latex source in `latex/` and the Jupyter notebook source
in `notebooks`.

To run the notebooks, clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:awni/automata_ml.git
```

Then install [GTN](https://github.com/gtn-org/gtn), the software I use for
constructing graphs:

```
pip install gtn
```

From `notebooks/`, launch the Jupyter server:

```
jupyter notebook
```

This should open a browser window from which you can execute all of the
notebooks.
